# ContosoUniversity I

### Summary
This application expands upon the ubiquitous ContosoUniversity sample application distributed by Mircrosoft  demonstrating the use of Entity Framework 6 in ASP.Net MVC.  This is the first of several posts that will explore different architectural approaches to building the same application.

**Project Highlights:**
- Asp.NET MVC
- Bootstrap
- Onion Architecture
- Generic Repository Pattern
- Entity Framework 6 and Fluent API
- Dependency Injection with Unity
- Modular Javascript
