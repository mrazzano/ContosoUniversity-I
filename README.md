# ContosoUniversity I

### Summary
This application expands upon the ubiquitous ContosoUniversity sample application distributed by Mircrosoft to demonstrate use of Entity Framework 6 in an ASP.Net MVC 5 web application.  This is the first of several posts that will explore different architectural approaches to building the same application to develop a better understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. 

ContosoUniversity I builds upon the original sample application and introduces Onion Architecture and the Generic Repository Pattern.

**Project Highlights:**
- MVC 5 
- Bootstrap
- Onion Architecture
- Generic Repository Pattern
- Entity Framework 6 and Fluent API
- Dependency Injection with Unity
- Modular Javascript
- LESS CSS framework
